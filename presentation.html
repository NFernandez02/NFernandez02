    <h1>Stoicheion: Chemistry Based Card Game</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Stoicheion is a chemistry-based card game where you compete against a computer or another player. The goal is to reduce your opponent's health points to zero in order to win.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The game's main mechanic revolves around the elements' acidity and base levels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acidity</strong>: Corresponds to the attack value, directly used to damage your opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>Base</strong>: Corresponds to the defense value, which must be played on the field to take effect.</li>
        <li>The greater the acid level, the higher the attack value, and vice versa.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each player starts with 50 HP. Each player is dealt 7 cards from the deck and can select one factory card from the deck.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spell Cards</strong>: Boost factory cards or enhance the effects of element cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Factory Cards</strong>: Produce specific elemental cards.</li>
        <li>During your turn, you can combine elements to create compounds, resulting in more powerful cards for attack or defense.</li>
        <li>Some cards have special effects that can be activated. Acidity effects can be used from your hand, while Base effects must be on the playing field to activate.</li>
    </ul>
