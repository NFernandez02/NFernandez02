# Porta Logica: An Escape Room Puzzle Game

## About
In Porta Logica, a high-stakes escape room puzzle game, your only way out is by mastering logic gates like OR, AND, and NOT. But you're not aloneâ€”a relentless entity is on your trail, growing smarter with each level.

Solve puzzles under pressure, unlock doors, and outwit the ever-evolving AI. Can you escape before it catches up?

## Objective
- Solve a series of logical gate puzzles to escape.
- Manage a timer; if the timer exceeds, more entities will appear, and they will become more resilient.
- Avoid the attacking entity; use small gaps in some rooms to crawl into and escape the entity.
