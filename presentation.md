## About
Stoicheion is a chemistry-based card game where you compete against a computer or another player. The goal is to reduce your opponent's health points to zero in order to win.

- **Acidity**: Corresponds to the attack value, directly used to damage your opponent.
- **Base**: Corresponds to the defense value, which must be played on the field to take effect.

Each player starts with 50 HP. Each player is dealt 7 cards from the deck and can select one factory card from the deck.
- **Spell Cards**: Boost factory cards or enhance the effects of element cards.
- **Factory Cards**: Produce specific elemental cards.
- During your turn, you can combine elements to create compounds, resulting in more powerful cards for attack or defense.
- Some cards have special effects that can be activated. Acidity effects can be used from your hand, while Base effects must be on the playing field to activate.
